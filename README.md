👋 Hi, I’m @anzuukka. I am a graphic designer by trade, and I am currently working as a UX/UI design trainee in Helsinki, Finland. I’m currently learning JavaScript and I have basic knowledge of HTML and CSS. Would love to combine these skills in the future!
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting projects that make the world a better place.
